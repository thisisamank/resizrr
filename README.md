### ‚ùì What is the real-world problem this project is solving?

Whenever we upload a photo on instagram, Whatsapp dp ,linkedin or on any website which accepts a `square` image the photos gets cropped. To solve this problem there are lot of apps on google play which does this but most of them are either filled with annoying ads or are very big in size and this is the problem  this project is trying to solve. I wanted to create an app which has most used features of these `squaring` apps with no-ads and light weight.

If you like this project, don't forget to give it a star ‚≠ê and fork this project.
